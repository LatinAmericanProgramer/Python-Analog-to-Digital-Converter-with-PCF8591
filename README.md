# Python-Analog-to-Digital-Converter-with-PCF8591
This tutorial make used of a Raspberry Pi model B and the AD/DA converter PCF8591T from SUNFOUNDER to gather analog signals, following the book "Raspberry pi Cookbook for python programmers" in its chapter 7.

Please feel free to read first the file DOCUMENT TUTORIAL before starting working with the scripts.

Summary

* Use "log_adc.py" to collect data from the PCF8591 input pins and to writing this data to a LogFile
* Use "log_graph.py" to use the data recorded into a "data.log" and plot this data.
* Use "data_adc.py" to work with I2C bus using wiringpi
* Use "data_local.py" to gather analog data without hardware.
